One full game exists of 5 round each having 13 games and 2 possibilities to reroll after the initial roll. The players switch turns and the score sheet is displayed after both players have done one game (one score field filled in).

Once the initial roll has been done the player can choose to keep some or all dice (keeping all will end the round for the player since there is nothing to reroll). Before rerolling the player can choose to add any dice they have in their possession to add them to the rerolling dice set. Choosing to leave dice behind to reroll or to return dice is permanent and cannot be undone. The game asks the player several times if they are sure of their action>

Once all dice have been fixed or the player is out of rerolls the score selection for that player will show. It shows all possible option but not all of them get you a score. The amount of points you get are displayed behind the option.

If the field is already filled in the player cannot enter a new score.

Once both players have chosen a score that marks the end of one game and the score sheets for both players are displayed.

After all the rounds have been played (5 round of 13 games) the game will display the final score sheets and the winner with the final total scores (These are also visible in the score sheets).
